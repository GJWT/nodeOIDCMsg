```js
ms('2 days')  // 172800000
ms('1d')      // 86400000
ms('10h')     // 36000000
ms('2.5 hrs') // 9000000

```js
ms(60000)             // "1m"
ms(2 * 60000)         // "2m"
ms(ms('10 hours'))    // "10h"
```

```js
ms(60000, { long: true })             // "1 minute"

- Node/Browser compatible. Published as [`ms`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ms) in [NPM](http://nodejs.org/download).
- If a number is supplied to `ms`, a string with a unit is returned.
- If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it as
a number (e.g: it returns `100` for `'100'`).
- If you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, the number of
equivalent ms is returned.
